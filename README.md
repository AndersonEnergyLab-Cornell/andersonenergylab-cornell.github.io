Anderson Research Group Website
============

This is the website for the Anderson Research Team at Cornell University. We are engineers and applied mathematicians that study decarbonization of energy systems. 

The site is forked from [Vivek Srikrishnan's Research Group](https://viveks.bee.cornell.edu) originally forked from [Steven V. Miller](http://svmiller.com).
