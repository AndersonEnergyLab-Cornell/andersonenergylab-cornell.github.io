Srikrishnan Research Group Website
============

This is the website for the Srikrishnan Research Group, in Cornell's Department of Biological & Environmental Engineering. We study the management of dynamic environmental hazards, particularly those resulting from climate change.

The base code is forked from [Steven V. Miller](http://svmiller.com). Some code and layout ideas were adapted from the [Doss-Gollin Lab website](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io).
