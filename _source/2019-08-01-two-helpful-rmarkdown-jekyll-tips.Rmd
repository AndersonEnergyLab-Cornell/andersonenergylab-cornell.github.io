It's crazy to think [I transitioned my website from Wordpress to Jekyll](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/08/create-your-website-in-jekyll/) four years ago this month. About two and a half years ago [(example)](http://svmiller.com/blog/2017/07/how-serious-are-americans-about-democracy-americasbarometer/), I started doing some R blogging by using [the `servr` package](https://github.com/yihui/servr) to render some R Markdown-based analyses as blog posts.

The former experience (Jekyll) has been much easier than the latter experience (getting R Markdown to play nice with Jekyll). Basically, `servr` works as a wrapper for rendering a site in Jekyll, scanning a directory for some source R Markdown scripts and rendering them as blog posts. I've never had a great experience with it for two reasons. First, `servr` always struck me as clunky in approach and perhaps even clunkier in execution. It's a great tool for compiling and rendering R Markdown files as a blog posts, but it seems like conceptual overkill when only a handful of my blog posts include analyses in R. I found the experience clunky as well. `servr` seemed to take more time building ("serving") my website than a standard `jekyll serve -w` call in a terminal. It wanted to render any R Markdown file it could find rather than the one I wanted it to render, which raised the possibility of it breaking a post from a few years ago because of a package dependency issue that I may not have noticed emerge over the years. It would also choke, violently, on any error I committed in the document and take 30 seconds or so to reset after spamming the R console with errors. [There has to be a better way!](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZG3r5)

I think I stumbled on two tips for a better blogging experience with Jekyll and R Markdown and thought sharing them here might help some others.

## Manually Render R Markdown Posts with a Few Lines in YAML 

It might be better to skip `servr` altogether and just manually compile your R Markdown posts to the `_posts` directory (where Jekyll stores blog posts by default). Just a few lines in the YAML will do it.

First, assume you store your R Markdown posts in a separate directory (typically `_source`, which is [how I have it on my Github](https://github.com/svmiller/svmiller.github.io/tree/master/_source)) and want to render them to the `_posts` directory. This is what the `servr` package does when it builds a Jekyll site. Toward that end, keep the R Markdown files in that `_source` directory but change your YAML to be someting like this (based on the post on which I'm working right now).

```yaml

This looks like boilerplate YAML for any post on a Jekyll blog. It's the `output:` and `knit:` fields I want to highlight here. First, I think it's a better approach for my blogging workflow to just manually render a document as if I were rendering an academic paper. For this purpose, change the output to `md_document:`. The `variant: gfm` (Github-flavored markdown) is probably optional, but `preserve_yaml: TRUE` is not. Make sure to put that in there.

The `knit:` option is a convoluted way of specifying that the finished markdown document should be in the `_posts` directory. The relative path there (i.e. `../`) says to backtrack one directory (i.e. from `_source`) to the root directory, and then go into the `_posts` directory. 

I like this workflow better than using `servr` to build my blog. Here, I can build my site in terminal with `jekyll serve -w` and open up the preview version at `http://localhost:4000`, and use R Markdown to knit the R Markdown document as a blog post. From there, it's a matter of clicking the link to the blog post in the browser and refreshing every time I update the R Markdown document to see what it looks like.

## Tweak Where the R Graphs Are Stored

One problem I kept encountering in doing R Markdown blogging is the graphs I generated would never have the URLs I wanted them to have. I usually set a setup chunk with an option like `knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = '../images')`. This saved the graphs where I wanted them to go (i.e. in [the `images` directory on my blog](https://github.com/svmiller/svmiller.github.io/tree/master/images)) because the `_source` or `_post` directory shares the same directory as the `images` directory. However, the rendered post would have images with locations like `http://svmiller.com/2019/08/images/image-name.png` because of my custom permalinks when I wanted `http://svmiller.com/images/image-name.png`.

This too is an easy fix. For each of the R Markdown posts in the source directory, make a `setup` chunk at the top of the document (after the YAML). Set `include=FALSE` and `cache=FALSE`, Then add the following bits of code, per [this post from Randi Griffin](http://www.randigriffin.com/2017/04/25/how-to-knit-for-mysite.html).

```r
base_dir <- "~/Dropbox/svmiller.github.io/" # i.e. where the jekyll blog is on the hard drive.
base_url <- "/" # keep as is
fig_path <- "images/" # customize to heart's content, I 'spose.

knitr::opts_knit$set(base.dir = base_dir, base.url = base_url)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = fig_path,
                      cache.path = '../cache/',
                      message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,
                      cache = TRUE) 
```

The R Markdown blogging workflow is much more straightforward after that. I can now seamlessly generate and display some graphs when I render the R Markdown document. For example, here is a graph on GDP forecasts I did and stored in my `stevemisc` package as [a data set](https://github.com/svmiller/stevemisc/blob/master/man/usa_chn_gdp_forecasts.Rd). This is for an in-class lecture for [my intro class](http://posc1020.svmiller.com/) on the future of international politics (in particular, the ["Rise of China"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Century)).

```{r gdp-forecasts-usa-chn, fig.height=10, fig.width = 14}
usa_chn_gdp_forecasts %>% 
  mutate(gdp = ifelse(is.na(gdp), f_gdp, gdp)) %>%
  mutate(gdp = gdp/1e12,
         f_lo80 = f_lo80/1e12,
         f_hi80 = f_hi80/1e12) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(year, gdp,  linetype=Country, color = Country, fill=Country)) +
  theme_steve_web() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = f_lo80, ymax = f_hi80), alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_line(size=1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1960, 2050, by = 10)) +
  xlab("") + ylab("Gross Domestic Product (Observed and Forecasted) in Trillions Constant 2010 US$") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2037,linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  annotate("text", x=2036, y = 35, 
           label = "China surpasses the U.S. in GDP\n(2037)", 
           hjust = 1, family = "Open Sans")  +
  labs(title = "China Should Surpass the U.S. in GDP by 2037",
       subtitle = "China's yearly growth in economic activity to date is greater than the growth we observe in U.S. economic output even as (reasonable) worries about China's economic trajectory persist.",
       caption = "Data: World Bank national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files. Forecast based on last year in World Bank data (2017).")
