We have a new paper in [Philosophy of Science](https://doi.org/10.1086/711501){:target="_blank"} with [Casey Helgeson](https://sites.google.com/site/caseyhelgeson/){:target="_blank"}, [Klaus Keller](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~kzk10/){:target="_blank"}, and [Nancy Tuana](https://philosophy.la.psu.edu/people/nat3/){:target="_blank"}. We discuss the epistemic value of simplicity as a property of models and the relevance of model simplicity for informing decision-making under uncertainty.

A preprint is available [here](https://philpapers.org/rec/HELWSC-3){:target="_blank"}.
