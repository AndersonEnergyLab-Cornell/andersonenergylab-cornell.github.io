This paper looks at long term climate simulations in concert with the NYS CLCPA energy system decarbonization plan to explore the challenges that might arise in an operational setting over the middle-to-long term. The pre-print is available [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/ooenergy/oiad003), pending typesetting by the journal. Congrats [Kenji](https://cals.cornell.edu/kenji-doering)!
