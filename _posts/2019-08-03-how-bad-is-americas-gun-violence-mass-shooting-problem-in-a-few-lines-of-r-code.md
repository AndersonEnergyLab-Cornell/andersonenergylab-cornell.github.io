[Another day, another mass shooting](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/03/us/el-paso-shooting/index.html) for literally the only country of its size and development where this happens on a routine basis. This one in El Paso may (reportedly) have some domestic terrorist overtones to it, but barring confirmation of the shooter and the shooter's motives for the moment, this post will focus on just the gun violence and the mass shooting angle here.

Gun control emerged as a political and academic hobby horse of mine largely because the problem strikes me as a massive and obvious public health problem that has a fairly simple solution on paper. Cheap gun supply---especially of weapons like AR-15s and AK-47s that have no practical use for hobbyists, hunters, ranchers, or those with an earnest interest in self-defense---decreases the transaction costs associated with carrying out violent rampages (see: [Wintemute, 2005](https://ucdavis.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/guns-and-gun-violence) and [Bartley and Williams, 2018](https://events.iadb.org/events/handler/geteventdocument.ashx?AFCF784DCD0CBF43BE2C6862BF3344018A6A5CB902FA5578FDC3D0A580A830F93EB421FAAECD73D52562D8C42E362FA5853AE10D3E97D4160C156BD8B16088D305C031362E48EDD5)). The quality of those assault rifles in particular also increase the costs for first-responders, putting them at risk and delaying much needed aid. This raises the societal costs for these "transactions" carried out by perpetrators. Restricting gun supply should raise the transaction costs associated with executing a violent rampage. Again, it's not hard. If you don't believe that, then you don't believe people respond to economic incentives.

Obviously, there's no political will here. [The public opinion is there](http://svmiller.com/research/what-americans-really-think-about-gun-control/) in support of most forms of gun control, even subtly aggressive forms of gun control, but GOP voters are gradually adopting cues from GOP elites on this topic. At the elite-level, the GOP relies on the National Rifle Association---which wants cheap guns for purchase to the benefit of gun manufacturers---to help [message "conservatism" to the voting bloc](https://www.amazon.com/Guns-Democracy-Insurrectionist-Joshua-Horwitz/dp/0472033700) and massage over other issues for GOP partisans (on fiscal policies, for example). The National Rifle Association is well-funded and partisan sorting has made them credible threats to primary GOP legislators who don't cooperate with them.

Alas, here we are: massive public health problem---*needless* public health problem---fairly simple and straightforward policy proposals, and no real (collective) will to do them. ðŸ¤·

Anywho, a few lines of R code will emphasize the scope of the problem.

First, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime data (see: [here](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Homicides_by_firearms.xls)) will emphasize how the U.S. stands out among peer countries. I link to the spreadsheet in this post. It's an *ugly* spreadsheet that requires some tidying and eye-balling things in LibreOffice for slicing, but it can be done all the same. Do note: the data are mostly limited to 2009/2010 observations, not that it should meaningfully change the takeaway here. The U.S. will conspicuously be an island among peer countries (i.e. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Western/Northern Europe) for its homicide by firearm rate.

Finally, you can start thinking about automating a script to scan [the Mother Jones database on mass shootings](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) to note how this problem is only getting worse. In subsequent updates, I might try to fully automate this with built-in assessments of how much worse the problem is getting.

Because it's only getting worse.

library(gsheet)

mass_shootings = gsheet2tbl('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b9o6uDO18sLxBqPwl_Gh9bnhW-ev_dABH83M5Vb5L8o/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0')

mass_shootings %>%
  separate(date, c("month","day","year"), sep="/") %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::as_date(paste0(year,"-",month,"-", day))) %>%
  select(case, date, everything()) %>%
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(year, n)) +

       subtitle = "There were 31 mass shootings from 1982-1999. There've been 28---29, including El Paso---in the past 2.5 years.",
       caption = "Data: Mother Jones. Methodology: pretty sure these are shooting incidents in which at least three people died. Earlier classifications of mass shootings counted four or more casualties, if I recall correctly.")
