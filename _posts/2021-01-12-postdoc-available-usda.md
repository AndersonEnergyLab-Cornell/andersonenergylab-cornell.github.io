Cornell BEE is [advertising](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/17811) for a postdoc! The position is part of a USDA-funded, interdisciplinary team looking at agricultural-to-energy transitions in New York State. The postdoc will be co-supervised by [Lindsay Anderson](https://blogs.cornell.edu/anderson1/), [Scott Steinschneider](https://blogs.cornell.edu/steinschneider/), and myself, and will have the opportunity to interact widely with other faculty.

We're interested in developing an energy demand model which is sensitive to nonlinear climate dynamics, as well as applying a climate stress test to a model of the New York State power system, which the postdoc would also help to develop. There are many interesting questions at the nexus of energy, water, and climate that the hired candidate would be able to explore.

A successful candidate would have:
  * A Ph.D in power and energy systems or operations research;
  * Programming skills in at least one major programming language (*e.g.* R, Python, Julia, etc.)
  * Experience and proficiency with statistical modeling;
  * Good communication skills and an interest and ability in developing working relationships with stakeholders.

  The anticipated start date is April 1, 2021, though this is flexible. To apply, go to [Academic Jobs Online](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/17811). And feel free to [email me](mailto: vs498@cornell.edu) if you have any questions!
