We have a new paper with [Klaus Keller](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~kzk10/){:target="_blank"} and [Casey Helgeson](https://sites.google.com/site/caseyhelgeson/){:target="_blank"} in the [*Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences*](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-earth-080320-055847){:target="_blank"}. We review several key challenges in decision-relevant climate risk management research, including:

* linking the required disciplines;
* identifying relevant values and objectives; 
* identifying and quantifying important uncertainties;
* resolving interactions between decision levers and the system dynamics;
* quantifying the trade-offs between diverse values under deep and dynamic uncertainties;
* communicating key information with decision-makers; and
* linking decision-making needs to research design and execution.

We then describe avenues for overcoming these challenges to enable [not only doing the science right, but doing the right science](https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119067825.ch10){:target="_blank"}.
