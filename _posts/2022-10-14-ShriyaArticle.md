Shriya's recent article explores new methods for networks that are robust to oscillations that may arise from renewable energy resources. The article appears in [IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9919347). Congrats to Shriya and collaborators on a job well done!
