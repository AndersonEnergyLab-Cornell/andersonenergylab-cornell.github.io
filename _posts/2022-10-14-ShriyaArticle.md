Shriya Nagpal's recent article explores new methods for designing networks that are robust to oscillations that may arise from renewable energy resources. The article appears in [IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9919347). Congrats to Shriya and collaborators [Gokul Nair](https://nairgokul.github.io) and [Prof. Francesca Parise](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/parise/) on a job well done!
