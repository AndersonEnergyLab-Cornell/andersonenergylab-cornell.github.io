* I am currently teaching BEE 5459 (Energy Seminar 1, fall semester) and BEE 5469 (Energy Seminar II, spring semester). I also occasionally teach [BEE 4880/6880, Applied Modeling and Optimization for Renewable Energy Systems](http://courses.cornell.edu), though it is currently taught by Prof. Jacob Mays in CEE.
